# Is Physical Risk Priced?


## Commodity-level physical risk estimates

### Distribution of Production Sources

The distribution of production sources for commodities is crucial in understanding the exposure to physical risks. Different commodities have varying levels of vulnerability based on their production locations and methods. For instance, commodities produced in regions prone to extreme weather events or natural disasters may face higher physical risks.

### Hazards, Intensity and Severity

Based on each historical events on IBTrACS, we generate 30 synthetic tracks using a random track generator. 

### Expected Annual Impact




## Physical Risk Factor Portfolio

We use the expected annual impact of physical risks on commodities to construct a factor portfolio. This portfolio is designed to capture the systematic risk associated with physical hazards affecting commodity production.
