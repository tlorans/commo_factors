# Dynamic Factor Strategies and Predictability

An investor can capture the average premia offered by commodity factors through a passive investment strategy in factor portfolios. 
The passive investment strategy rebalances periodically the commodity factor portfolios in accordance with the chose portfolio construction methodology and will be optimal if return and risk are constant or unpredictable.

Successful commodity timing strategies on the other hand, requires ability to forecast commodity returns, risks or both. 

Evidence on the predictability of commodity returns is controversial. Following previous research on the predictability of commodity returns we consider:

- macroeconomic predictor variables (T-bill 1 month, yield spread, default spread, unemployment rate, money supply growth, industrial production growth and the Killian real economic activity index) 
-commodity-specific predictor variables (aggregate commodity basis, commodity market interest, the growth in "commodity currency" exchange rates and the 1-month lagged commodity return)
- factor exposure spreads defined as the difference in the factor exposure of the high and low commodity factor portfolios

We employ four forecasting models:

- the historical average
- the forecast combination (pooled average)
- the diffusion index model
- the multiple regression model


## Forecasting Variables

## Performance of Commodity Timing Factor Strategies

In this section we evaluate the performance of a dynamic strategy that adjusts the weight allocated to a commodity factor premium using the forecass of risk and return.
