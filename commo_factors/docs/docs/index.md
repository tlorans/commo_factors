# Factor-based commodity investing

There is growing evidence that commodity investment strategies based on exposures to commodity fundamental characteristics earn significant premiums, in addition to the premium offered by a broadly diversified commodity index. This is consistent with the findings in equity and fixed income markets, where factor-based strategies have been shown to outperform traditional market-capitalization-weighted indices.

Research identified that commodity investment strategies based on exposures to commodity fundamental characteristics such as the basis, momentum, basis-momentum, value, inflation, hedging pressure, volatility, speculative pressure, skewness, dollar beta and liquidity outperform commodity indices such as the S&P GSCI or a passive equally weighted index of all commodities (see Miffre, 2016[1] for a review).

Sakkas and Tessaromatis, 2020[2] ask the following four questions:

1. Which commodity factors are priced? Existing evidence on commodity pricing supports a four-factor model that includes the average commodity factor and the basis, momentum and the basis momentum factors. 
2. What is the optimal commodity portfolio when commodity returns are driven by multiple commodity factors? In the presence of multiple priced commodity factors, the investor should hold a multi-factor portfolio. 
3. How does the performance of a multi-factor commodity portfolio compare with the performance of existing commodity indices? This can be compared to existing commodity indices such as the S&P GSCI or a passive equally weighted index of all commodities.
4. Are commodity factor portfolio returns predictable and if so, is it possible to create dynamic factor strategies that outperform passive commodity factor strategies?

This is what we are going to explore in this simple exploration of factor-based commodity investing. Note that we are limited to data access and will therefore focus on a subset of the factors identified in the literature.
